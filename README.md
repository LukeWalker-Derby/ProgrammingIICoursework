# ProgrammingIICoursework
This contains my solution to the Programming II module coursework from my first year along with the diary.

Looking back at this work there are things that I would have done differently. For example the recurring calendar entry could have inherited from the single calendar entry, this would have saved time and made the code simpler and would have resulted in a higher mark.
